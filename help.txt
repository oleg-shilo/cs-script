Copyright (C) 2004-2017 Oleg Shilo.

Usage: cscs <switch 1> <switch 2> <file> [params] [//x]

<switch 1>

-help|-? [command]
    Displays either generic or command specific help info.
    Reversed order of parameters for the command specific help is also
    acceptable. The all following argument combinations print the same help topic
    for 'cache' command:
       -help cache
       -? cache
       -cache help
       -cache ?

-e
    Compiles script into console application executable.

-ew
    Compiles script into Windows application executable.

-c[:<0|1>]
    Uses compiled file (cache file .compiled) if found (to improve performance).
       -c:1|-c  enable caching
       -c:0     disable caching (which might be enabled globally);

-ca
    Compiles script file into assembly (cache file .compiled) without execution.

-cd
    Compiles script file into assembly (.dll) without execution.

-check
    Checks script for errors without execution.

-proj
    Shows script 'project info' - script and all its dependencies.

-cache[:<ls|trim|clear>]
    Performs script cache operations.
     ls    - lists all cache items.
     trim  - removes all abandoned cache items.
     clear - removes all cache items.

-co:<options>
    Passes compiler options directly to the language compiler.
    (e.g.  -co:/d:TRACE pass /d:TRACE option to C# compiler
    or  -co:/platform:x86 to produce Win32 executable)

-s|-sample[:<C# version>]
    Prints content of sample script file.
     -s:7    - prints C# 7 sample. Otherwise it prints the default canonical
    'Hello World' sample.
    (e.g. cscs -s:7 > sample.cs).

-wait[:prompt]
    Waits for user input after the execution before exiting.
    If specified the execution will proceed with exit only after any std input is
    received.
    Applicable for console mode only.
    prompt - if none specified 'Press any key to continue...' will be used

-ac|-autoclass[:<0|1|2|out>]
    
     -ac     - enables auto-class decoration (which might be disabled globally).
     -ac:0   - disables auto-class decoration (which might be enabled globally).
     -ac:1   - same as '-ac'
     -ac:2   - same as '-ac:1' and '-ac'
     -ac:out - prints auto-class decoration for a given script file. The argument
               must be followed by the path to script file.
     
    Automatically generates 'static entry point' class if the script doesn't
    define any.
     
        using System;
     
        void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!";
        }
     
    Using an alternative 'instance entry point' is even more convenient (and
    reliable).
    The acceptable 'instance entry point' signatures are:
     
        void main()
        void main(string[] args)
        int main()
        int main(string[] args)
     
    Note, having any active code above entry point is acceptable though it
    complicates the troubleshooting if such a code contains errors. (see
    https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script/wiki/CLI---User-Guide#command-auto-cl
    ass)
     
    By default CS-Script decorates the script by adding a class declaration
    statement to the start of the script routine and a class closing bracket to
    the end. This may have an unintended effect as any class declared in the
    script becomes a 'nested class'. While it is acceptable for practically all
    use-cases it may be undesired for just a few scenarios. For example, any
    class containing method extensions must be a top level static class, what
    conflicts with the auto-class decoration algorithm.
     
    The solution to this problem is to allow some user code to be protected from
    being included into User can achieve this by placing '//css_ac_end' statement
    into the code. Any user code below this statement will be excluded from the
    decoration and stay unchanged.

---------
<switch 2>

-nl
    No logo mode: No banner will be shown/printed at execution time.
    Applicable for console mode only.

-dbg|-d
    Forces compiler to include debug information.

-l
    'local' (makes the script directory a 'current directory').

-v
    Prints CS-Script version information.

-inmem[:<0|1>]
    Loads compiled script in memory before execution.
    This mode allows preventing locking the compiled script file. Can be
    beneficial for fine concurrency control as it allows changing and executing
    the scripts that are already loaded (being executed). This mode is
    incompatible with the scripting scenarios that require script assembly to be
    file based (e.g. advanced Reflection).
     -inmem:1   enable caching (which might be disabled globally);
     -inmem:0   disable caching (which might be enabled globally);

-dir:<directory 1>,<directory N>
    Adds path(s) to the assembly probing directory list.
    You can use a reserved word 'show' as a directory name to print the
    configured probing directories.
    (e.g. cscs -dir:C:\MyLibraries myScript.cs cscs -dir:-show).

-verbose
    Prints runtime information during the script execution.
    (applicable for console clients only)

-stop
    Stops all running instances of Roslyn sever (VBCSCompiler.exe).
    (applicable for .NET/Windows only)

-tc
    Trace compiler input produced by CS-Script code provider CSSRoslynProvider.dll.
    It's useful when troubleshooting custom compilers (e.g. Roslyn on Linux).

-config[:<option>]
    Performs various CS-Script config operations
     -config:none               - ignores config file (uses default settings)
     -config:create             - creates config file with default settings
     -config:default            - prints default config file
     -config:<raw|xml>          - prints current config file content
     -config[:ls]               - lists/prints current config values
     -config:get:name           - prints current config value
     -config:set:name=value     - sets current config value
     -config:set:name=add:value - updates the current config value content by
                                  appending the specified value.
     -config:set:name=del:value - updates the current config value content by
                                  removing all occurrences of the specified
                                  value.
     -config:set:roslyn         - enables Roslyn integration via configuration
                                  (C#7 support)
     -config:<file>             - uses custom config file
     
    Note: The property name in -config:set and -config:set is case insensitive
    and can also contain '_' as a token separator that is ignored during property
    lookup.
    (e.g. cscs -config:none sample.cs
    cscs -config:default > css_VB.xml
    cscs -config:set:inmem=true
    cscs -config:set:DefaultArguments=add:-ac
    cscs -config:set:default_arguments=del:-ac
    cscs -config:c:\cs-script\css_VB.xml sample.vb)

-out[:<file>]
    Forces the script to be compiled into a specific location.
    Used only for very fine hosting tuning.
    (e.g. cscs -out:%temp%\%pid%\sample.dll sample.cs

-sconfig[:file]
    Uses script config file or custom config file as a .NET app.config.
    This option might be useful for running scripts, which usually cannot be
    executed without configuration file (e.g. WCF, Remoting).
    (e.g. if -sconfig is used the expected config file name is
    <script_name>.cs.config or <script_name>.exe.configif -sconfig:myApp.config
    is used the expected config file name is myApp.config)

-r:<assembly 1>,<assembly N>
    Uses explicitly referenced assembly.
    It is required only for rare cases when namespace cannot be resolved into
    assembly.
    (e.g. cscs /r:myLib.dll myScript.cs).

-precompiler[:<file 1>,<file N>]
    Specifies custom precompiler. This can be either script or assembly file.
    Alias - pc[:<file 1>,<file N>]
    If no file(s) specified prints the code template for the custom precompiler.
    The spacial value 'print' has the same effect (e.g. cscs -pc:print).
    There is a special reserved word 'nodefault' to be used as a file name. It
    instructs script engine to prevent loading any built-in precompilers like the
    one for removing shebang before the execution.
    (see http://www.csscript.net/help/precompilers.html)

-pvdr|-provider:<file>
    Location of the alternative/custom code provider assembly.
    Alias - pvdr:<file>
    If set it forces script engine to use an alternative code compiler.
    C#7 support is implemented via Roslyn based provider:
    '-pvdr:CSSRoslynProvider.dll'.If the switch is not specified
    CSSRoslynProvider.dll file will be use as a code providerif it is found in
    the same folder where the script engine is. Automatic CSSRoslynProvider.dll
    loading can be disabled with special 'none' argument: -pvdr:none.
    (see http://www.csscript.net/help/non_cs_compilers.html)

-syntax
    Prints documentation for CS-Script specific C# syntax.

-commands|-cmd
    Prints list of supported commands (arguments).

---------
file
    Specifies name of a script file to be run.

params
    Specifies optional parameters for a script file to be run.

//x
    Launch debugger just before starting the script.



**************************************
Script specific syntax
**************************************
 
Engine directives:
------------------------------------
//css_include <file>;
 
Alias - //css_inc
file - name of a script file to be included at compile-time.
 
This directive is used to include one script into another one.It is a logical
equivalent of '#include' in C++. It is a simplified version of //css_import.
 
If a relative file path is specified with a single-dot prefix it will be
automatically converted into the absolute path with respect to the location of
the file containing the directive being resolved.
 
Note if you use wildcard in the imported script name (e.g. *_build.cs) the
directive will only import from the firstprobing directory where the matching
file(s) is found. Be careful with the wide wildcard as '*.cs' as they may lead to
unpredictable behavior. For example they may match everything from the very first
probing directory, which is typically a current directory. Using more specific
wildcards is arguably more practical (e.g. 'utils/*.cs', '*Helper.cs', './*.cs')
------------------------------------
//css_import <file>[, preserve_main][, rename_namespace(<oldName>, <newName>)];
 
Alias - //css_imp
There are also another two aliases //css_include and //css_inc. They are
equivalents of //css_import <file>, preserve_main
If $this (or $this.name) is specified as part of <file> it will be replaced at
execution time with the main script full name (or file name only).
 
file            - name of a script file to be imported at compile-time.
<preserve_main> - do not rename 'static Main'
oldName         - name of a namespace to be renamed during importing
newName         - new name of a namespace to be renamed during importing
 
This directive is used to inject one script into another at compile time. Thus
code from one script can be exercised in another one.'Rename' clause can appear
in the directive multiple times.
------------------------------------
//css_include <file>;
 
Alias - //css_inc
This directive is a full but more convenient equivalent of //css_import <file>,
preserve_main;
------------------------------------
 
//css_nuget [-noref] [-force[:delay]] [-ver:<version>] [-ng:<nuget arguments>]
package0[,package1]..[,packageN];
 
Downloads/Installs the NuGet package. It also automatically references the
downloaded package assemblies.
Note: The directive switches need to be in the order as above.
 
By default the package is not downloaded again if it was already downloaded.
If no version is specified then the highest downloaded version (if any) will be
used.
Referencing the downloaded packages can only handle simple dependency scenarios
when all downloaded assemblies are to be referenced.
You should use '-noref' switch and reference assemblies manually for all other
cases. For example multiple assemblies with the same file name that target
different CLRs (e.g. v3.5 vs v4.0) in the same package.
Switches:
 -noref         - switch for individual packages if automatic referencing isn't
                  desired. 
                  You can use 'css_nuget' environment variable for further
                  referencing package content (e.g. //css_dir
                  %css_nuget%\WixSharp\**)
 -force[:delay] - switch to force individual packages downloading even when they
                  were already downloaded.
                  You can optionally specify delay for the next forced
                  downloading by number of seconds since last download.
                  '-force:3600' will delay it for one hour. This option is useful
                  for preventing frequent download interruptions during active
                  script development.
 -ver:<version> - switch to download/reference a specific package version.
 -ng:<args>     - switch to pass NuGet arguments for every individual package.
 
Example: //css_nuget cs-script;
         //css_nuget -ver:4.1.2 NLog
         //css_nuget -ver:"4.1.1-rc1" -ng:"-Pre -NoCache" NLog
 
This directive will install CS-Script NuGet package.
(see http://www.csscript.net/help/script_nugets.html)
------------------------------------
//css_args arg0[,arg1]..[,argN];
 
Embedded script arguments. The both script and engine arguments are allowed
except "/noconfig" engine command switch.
Example: //css_args -dbg, -inmem;
This directive will always force script engine to execute the script in debug
mode.
Note: the arguments must be coma separated.
------------------------------------
//css_reference <file>;
 
Alias - //css_ref
file - name of the assembly file to be loaded at run-time.
This directive is used to reference assemblies required at run time.
The assembly must be in GAC, the same folder with the script file or in the
'Script Library' folders (see 'CS-Script settings').
------------------------------------
//css_precompiler <file 1>,<file 2>;
 
Alias - //css_pc
file - name of the script or assembly file implementing precompiler.
 
This directive is used to specify the CS-Script precompilers to be loaded and
exercised against script at run time just before compiling it. Precompilers are
typically used to alter the script coder before the execution. Thus CS-Script
uses built-in precompiler to decorate classless scripts executed with -autoclass
switch.
(see http://www.csscript.net/help/precompilers.html
------------------------------------
//css_searchdir <directory>;
 
Alias - //css_dir
directory - name of the directory to be used for script and assembly probing at
run-time.
 
This directive is used to extend set of search directories (script and assembly
probing).
The directory name can be a wildcard based expression.In such a case all
directories matching the pattern will be this case all directories will be
probed.
The special case when the path ends with '**' is reserved to indicate 'sub
directories' case. Examples:
    //css_dir packages\ServiceStack*.1.0.21\lib\net40
    //css_dir packages\**
------------------------------------
//css_resource <file>[, <out_file>];
 
Alias - //css_res
file     - name of the compiled resource file (.resources) to be used with the
script.
           Alternatively it can be the name of the XML resource file (.resx) that
           will be compiled on-fly.
out_file - Optional name of the compiled resource file (.resources) to be
           generated form the .resx input.If not supplied then the compiled file
           will have the same name as the input file but the file extension
           '.resx' changed to '.resources'.
 
This directive is used to reference resource file for script.
 Example: //css_res Scripting.Form1.resources;
          //css_res Resources1.resx;
          //css_res Form1.resx, Scripting.Form1.resources;
------------------------------------
//css_co <options>;
 
options - options string.
 
This directive is used to pass compiler options string directly to the language
specific CLR compiler.
 Example: //css_co /d:TRACE pass /d:TRACE option to C# compiler
          //css_co /platform:x86 to produce Win32 executable
------------------------------------
//css_ignore_namespace <namespace>;
 
Alias - //css_ignore_ns
namespace - name of the namespace. Use '*' to completely disable namespace
resolution
 
This directive is used to prevent CS-Script from resolving the referenced
namespace into assembly.
------------------------------------
//css_prescript file([arg0][,arg1]..[,argN])[ignore];
//css_postscript file([arg0][,arg1]..[,argN])[ignore];
 
Aliases - //css_pre and //css_post
file    - script file (extension is optional)
arg0..N - script string arguments
ignore  - continue execution of the main script in case of error
 
These directives are used to execute secondary pre- and post-execution scripts.
If $this (or $this.name) is specified as arg0..N it will be replaced at execution
time with the main script full name (or file name only).
You may find that in many cases precompilers (//css_pc and -pc) are a more
powerful and flexible alternative to the pre-execution script.
------------------------------------
//css_host [-version:<CLR_Version>] [-platform:<CPU>]
 
CLR_Version - version of CLR the script should be execute on (e.g. //css_host
/version:v3.5)
CPU - indicates which platforms the script should be run on: x86, Itanium, x64,
or anycpu.
Sample: //css_host /version:v2.0 /platform:x86;
 
Note this directive only supported on Windows due to the fact that on Linux the
x86/x64 hosting implemented via runtime launcher 'mono'.
 
These directive is used to execute script from a surrogate host process. The
script engine application (cscs.exe or csws.exe) launches the script
execution as a separate process of the specified CLR version and CPU
architecture.
------------------------------------
 
Note the script engine always sets the following environment variables:
 'pid'                     - host processId (e.g.
                             Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("pid")
 'CSScriptRuntime'         - script engine version
 'CSScriptRuntimeLocation' - script engine location
 'cscs_exe_dir'            - script engine directory
 'EntryScript'             - location of the entry script
 'EntryScriptAssembly'     - location of the compiled script assembly
 'location:<assm_hash>'    - location of the compiled script assembly.
 
This variable is particularly useful as it allows finding the compiled assembly
file from the inside of the script code. Even when the script loaded in-memory
(InMemoryAssembly setting) but not from the original file. (e.g. var location =
Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("location:" +
Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetHashCode()); 
 
Note that by default setting of 'location:<assm_hash>' is disabled. You can
enable it by calling  'CSScript.EnableScriptLocationReflection = true'.
 
The following is the optional set of environment variables that the script engine
uses to improve the user experience:
 
 'CSS_NUGET' 
      location of the NuGet packages scripts can load/reference
 
 'CSSCRIPT_DIR'
      script engine location. Used by the engine to locate dependencies (e.g.
      resgen.exe). Typically this variable is during the CS-Script installation.
 
 'CSSCRIPT_CONSOLE_ENCODING_OVERWRITE'
      script engine output encoding if the one from the css_confix.xml needs to
      be overwritten.
 
 'CSSCRIPT_INC'
      a system wide include directory for the all frequently used user scripts.
------------------------------------
During the script execution CS-Script always injects a little object inspector
class 'dbg'. This class contains static printing methods that mimic Python's
'print()'. It is particularly useful for object inspection in the absence of a
proper debugger.
 
Examples:
  dbg.print("Now:", DateTime.Now)        - prints concatenated objects.
  dbg.print(DateTime.Now)                - prints object and values of its
                                           properties.
  dbg.printf("Now: {0}", DateTime.Now)   - formats and prints object and values
                                           of its fields and properties.
------------------------------------
 
Any directive has to be written as a single line in order to have no impact on
compiling by CLI compliant compiler.It also must be placed before any namespace
or class declaration.
 
------------------------------------
Example:
 
 //css_include web_api_host.cs;
 //css_reference media_server.dll;
 //css_nuget Newtonsoft.Json;
 
 using System;
 using static dbg;
 
 class MediaServer
 {
     static void Main(string[] args)
     {
         print(args);
 
         WebApi.SimpleHost(args)
               .StartAsConosle("http://localhost:8080");
   }
 }
 
Or shorter form:
 
 //css_args -ac
 //css_inc web_api_host.cs
 //css_ref media_server.dll
 //css_nuget Newtonsoft.Json
 
 using System;
 
 void main(string[] args)
 {
     print(args);
 
     WebApi.SimpleHost(args)
           .StartAsConosle("http://localhost:8080");
 }
