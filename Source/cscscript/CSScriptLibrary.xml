            Gets or sets a value indicating whether custom string hashing algorithm should be used.
            <para>
            String hashing is used by the script engine for allocating temporary and cached paths.
            However default string hashing is platform dependent (x32 vs. x64) what makes impossible
            truly deterministic string hashing. This in turns complicates the integration of the
            CS-Script infrastructure with the third-party applications (e.g. Notepad++ CS-Script plugin).
            </para>
            <para>
            To overcome this problem CS-Script uses custom string hashing algorithm (default setting).
            Though the native .NET hashing can be enabled if desired by setting <c>CustomHashing</c>

             The MetaDataItems class contains information about script dependencies (referenced local
             assemblies and imported scripts) and compiler options. This information is required when
             scripts are executed in a 'cached' mode (/c switch). On the base of this information the script
             engine will compile new version of .compiled assembly if any of it's dependencies is changed. This
             is required even for referenced local assemblies as it is possible that they are a strongly
             named assemblies (recompiling is required for any compiled client of the strongly named assembly
             in case this assembly is changed).
            
             The perfect place to store the dependencies info (custom meta data) is the assembly
             resources. However if we do so such assemblies would have to be loaded in order to read their
             resources. It is not acceptable as after loading assembly cannot be unloaded. Also assembly loading
             can significantly compromise performance.
            
             That is why custom meta data is just physically appended to the file. This is a valid
             approach because such assembly is not to be distributed anywhere but to stay always
             on the PC and play the role of the temporary data for the script engine.
            
             Note: A .dll assembly is always compiled and linked in a normal way without any custom meta data attached.
